# Setup instructions and resources

This folder contains instructions and resources for setting up your computer for the course.

## Python

You have several options:

1. If you have not yet worked with Python a lot, we recommend you follow the instructions in [setup_with_anaconda.md](./setup_python_with_anaconda.md), because you are guided through the installation and setup process with detailed guides and you can rely on easy-to-use interfaces for this.
2. If you are a MacOS user, and you want to use *homebrew* for the installation, follow the instructions in [setup_macos.md](./setup_macos.md)
3. If you know hot to create virtual environments and how to install requirements, you can directly install them from the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file

## Accounts to use commercial LLMs

Follow the instructions in [setup_openai.md](./setup_openai.md)

## `ollama` for using open-source LLMs

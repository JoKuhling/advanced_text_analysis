# Setup Google Colab

Please sign up with Google so that you can use Google Colab: https://colab.google/

If you have never worked with Google Colab before, please watch this short introduction video: https://youtu.be/RLYoEyIHL6A?si=yOohEqaqvdvSdKdV

<!-- Next, open the notebook [test_google_colab.ipynb](./test_google_colab.ipynb) in Google Colab and execute all code. In case this raises any errors, report to hauke.licht@uibk.ac.at -->

**_Optional:_**
Consider investing $ 9,99 (11,01 â‚¬) per month for a _Colab Pro_.
This will allow you to use more and better GPU resources.
And you can cancel your subscription monthly at any time.
